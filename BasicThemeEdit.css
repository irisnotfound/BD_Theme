Honestly
Regular parts in Studio are more optimized than Studio's unions
100k parts w/o unions doesnt usually cause lag with the current hardware technologies which are widely used by many nowaday
100k unions will immediately crash the game
so most viable options is to import parts to blender and make them into one mesh, then export back to studio
massively reducing amount of parts, but may have to sacrifice memory if used precise decompromise at that large scale (based on what I saw in the background of that picture)
